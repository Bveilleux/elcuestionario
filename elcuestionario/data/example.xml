    Questions and their answer options are defined here.

    Each question should have multiple answers which itself have weightings
    (a float number between 0.0 and 1.0; Exception: I sometimes use a value of
    1.1 for 'bonus answers' which allows for an overall score of more than
    100%). To calculate the overall score, the weighting of each question's
    answer will be used.

    This section contains the overall rating according to the achieved score.

    The 'minscore' value sets the threshold for each rating. The adequate
    rating will be chosen by finding the one with the highest minscore value
    that is lower than the score. For example, with a score of 53% and ratings
    with minscore values of [10, 20, ..., 90, 100], the selected rating will
    be the one with a minscore value of 50 since it is lower than 53 and the
    next higher minscore value, 60, is not lower than the score of 53.

    Therefore, a rating's minscore value defines the minimum score one has to
    gain to be given that rating, as long as no other rating is more suitable
    considering its minscore minimum.

    <ratings>
        <rating minscore="0">OMG, please waste time with something else!</rating>
        <rating minscore="10">Well, you've got potential. Somewhere. I think. Maybe. Or not.</rating>
        <rating minscore="40">Not bad.</rating>
        <rating minscore="70">Looking good.</rating>
        <rating minscore="90">Yeah, great result.</rating>
        <rating minscore="100">You better go see a doctor! ;-)</rating>
